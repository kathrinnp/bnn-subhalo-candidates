# Bayesian Neural Network Predictions for Fermi-LAT UNID Sources as DM subhalos

The file UNID_predictions.csv provides the network predictions for the unclassified Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR3 [1] sources, as outlined in ArXiv:2301.XXXXX [2]. 


For each source, we provide the prediction mean and standard deviation of each source to belong to each of the five models discussed in the paper (m_DM = [10, 30, 80, 300, 1000] GeV). 

All predictions and the respective standard deviations < 1 % are set to 0. Also, all sources that are cut as outlined in [2] only contain 0 entries.
